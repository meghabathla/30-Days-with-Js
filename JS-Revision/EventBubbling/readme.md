# When to Use Bubbling or Capturing

- Bubbling: Useful when you want to add a handler to a parent element to listen for events from multiple child elements, such as form submissions or clicks on a list.

- Capturing: Typically used for specific scenarios where you need to catch the event before it reaches the target element.
