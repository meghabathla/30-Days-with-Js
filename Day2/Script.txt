## Activity6: Airthmetic operation


Methods: Four methods (add, subtract, multiply, and divide) are defined to perform the respective arithmetic operations.
add(): Returns the sum of num1 and num2.
subtract(): Returns the difference between num1 and num2.
multiply(): Returns the product of num1 and num2.
divide(): Returns the quotient of num1 divided by num2. If num2 is zero, it returns an error message to avoid division by zero.

## Comparision & Logical operation 


Comparison Methods: Several methods are defined to perform comparison operations:

isEqual(): Checks if num1 is equal to num2.
isNotEqual(): Checks if num1 is not equal to num2.
isGreaterThan(): Checks if num1 is greater than num2.
isLessThan(): Checks if num1 is less than num2.
isGreaterThanOrEqual(): Checks if num1 is greater than or equal to num2.
isLessThanOrEqual(): Checks if num1 is less than or equal to num2.


Logical Methods: Methods are defined to perform logical operations:

andOperation(): Performs a logical AND between num1 and num2.
orOperation(): Performs a logical OR between num1 and num2.
notOperation(): Performs a logical NOT on num1.


## Terinary operator

The ternary operator (? :) is a shorthand for the if-else statement.
It takes three operands: a condition, a result for true, and a result for false.
The syntax is condition ? exprIfTrue : exprIfFalse.
